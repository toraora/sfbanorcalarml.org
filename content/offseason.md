title: Off-season Updates and Event Calendar 
---

While we're still a ways away from ramping up the 2026 ARML season, we want to share some updates and inform you of local math events that may be of interest.

First, to receive updates from us, join this season's mailing list [here](todo) and also join our Discord server [here](todo).

Secondly, we aim to represent and support the math community here in SFBA / Norcal and want to help increase awareness of all of the activities going on in the area. This season, we are piloting a program to offer a small discount on the ARML registration fee for each local math event attended. Many of these events are only possible through the hard work of volunteers (and often math enthusiasts like many of you), and we hope this might simultaneously drive and reward participation in the community.

Reach out to us at {{ email() }} if you have any questions.
