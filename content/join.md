There are four steps to joining the SFBA/NorCal ARML team. If you are interested in going to ARML, complete all four steps:

### 1. Read the [FAQ](/faq/) and [Policies](/policies/).

Read the [policy section](/policies/) carefully, as you will be required to agree to it when paying fees. You may skim the [FAQ section](/faq/) if you are already familiar with how ARML works.

### 2. Fill out the [Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A).

Fill out the [Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A) if you have any interest at all in ARML. It does not commit you to coming to ARML, nor does it reserve your spot on the team. Once you fill out the form, we will add you to the team email list, where we will send details about practices and important updates about the competition. Do this before paying ARML fees.

### 3. Pay the ARML fee on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/).

On [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/), create or log into a *student*
account. Under "Events Accepting Registrations", find "SFBA/NorCal ARML 2025"
and click on the "Register" button. Select "Register As Independent Student" and
complete the corresponding form. Please use the same name and email address as
you did in the Information Sheet. You will pay the ARML fee as part of this
process.

Once you pay the fee, you should see an info box that says "You must create or
join a team to complete registration." No action is required from you at this
point -- we will move you onto the "Registered Students" team once we review
your registration.

The $390 ARML fee represents your commitment to attending ARML. We must receive your payment by April 28th, and we cannot provide refunds after this date. You cannot be placed on a team until you have paid.

This fee includes transportation to ARML on Friday morning, transportation home
on Saturday evening, one night in the dorm, two meals on Saturday, and
a team t-shirt.

### 4. Fill out the permission slip.

We will send a permission slip via DocuSign to parents of all team members in 
early May. Permission slips must be electronically signed by May 28th.
Students who are missing a permission slip after that date may lose their spot on the team with no refund.

## Deadlines

We expect that all students who complete steps 1, 2, and 3 by April 28th will be able to participate at ARML. We will not be able to accommodate additional students after April 28th. 

## Coaches and Parent Volunteers

If you are an adult (parent, teacher, college student, alumnus, etc.) interested
in helping run practices or chaperoning the ARML trip, fill out the [Information
Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A). *Do not register on ContestDojo or
pay any fees.* Coaching staff will contact you with more information.
