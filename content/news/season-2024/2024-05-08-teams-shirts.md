Dear ARML Team,

It was great to see everyone at practice last Sunday, and I enjoyed closing our
practice with an ice cream social.

A few updates for this week, including a couple action items:

### Team Assignments

We announced the roster for this year's two elite teams (A1 and A2) on Sunday.
Those teams are listed below. As always, with all of the talent that we have on
our team, it was quite a difficult decision.

We will split our remaining teams into groups of 15 students. These
teams are not ranked, and will be divided regionally by default. We plan to
announce our regional teams at this weekend's practice, and to practice in those
teams on Saturday.

We're opening a limited time opportunity for students on regional teams to
request teammates. If you are on a regional team, you may submit a request by
end-of-day Thursday (today) to be placed on a team with specific other students.
While it might not be possible to fulfill every such request, we intend to honor
these requests as much as possible in the selection process.

Please note that practice attendance is a factor in both elite team placement
and selection of alternates; see the [Policies](/policies/) for more
information. In particular, elite team members who miss practices may be removed
from their teams, and we will select alternates during the week prior to the
competition based primarily on practice attendance.

If you'd like to request teammates, please complete the following form by **end
of day Thursday**:

### Second SFBA Practice

Our second SFBA practice will take place in Cupertino on **Saturday, noon to 5pm**,
at St. Joseph of Cupertino School. The details are on the [practice
website](/practices/). Like this past weekend, we'll spend the last 45 minutes
of practice doing something fun to help everyone meet each other.
We encourage everyone to carpool to practice with others from your city or area.

For SFBA students, if you're unable to attend, please fill out our [practice
absence form](https://forms.gle/4H4Pw6yBUGffMX3u5) and provide a (good) reason.
Examples of good reasons include health issues and conflicting events; we
generally discourage using studying for exams as a reason to miss practice.

### Practice Materials

Practice materials from our tryouts and the first Bay Area practice have now
been posted. Note that each team at practice covers different material -- if
your team hasn't covered something yet, please don't review it on your own, as
your team will likely use this material at our next practice.

### T-Shirt Poll

We have received 3 t-shirt designs, and have a few options to mix-and-match
those designs. Please vote for your preferred design by **end of day Thursday**.

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
