Dear ARML Team,

**Roster Check**

At the bottom of this email is the list of all students who are fully registered
and have a confirmed spot on our team. If you think that you're registered,
please look for your name in the list below. In case of any errors or changes,
get in touch with us as soon as possible so we can make corrections before
submitting this list to ARML.

**Roommate Form**

Now that our roster is pretty much set, we're giving everyone a chance to update
roommate requests. This form is due at 8:00pm on Friday, and we'll do our best
to accommodate requests that we receive by then. Requests must be mutual - both
parties need to request each other. Note that we will likely be required to
separate students over 18 and under 18 in the roommate assignments.

[Submit your roommate preferences here.](https://forms.gle/KfR9CsAxP2rT6AoX6)

**Upcoming Events**

We will hold elite team tryouts online on ContestDojo on April 28 and May 4. The
Bay Area teams will hold practices on May 5, 11, and 18, while Sacramento will
continue to hold weekly practices as well. The details are available at
https://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/.

In the coming week, we will also reach out regarding transportation.  By
default, everyone's transportation will be a bus seat provided by the team. If
you're considering traveling to ARML independently with your parents, we will
have information for you soon. (In short, we will designate a drop-off time on
Friday and a pick-up time on Saturday, and ask all independent travelers to
comply with those times.)

In the coming weeks, we will also send out permission slips to parents
for electronic signatures -- watch out for instructions in future emails.

**T-Shirt Designs**

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by April 28. Please see
[this post](/news/season-2024/2024-arml-information/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at {{ email() }} and we may be able to help.

**A note on the Sunday return option**

Unfortunately, even though many students indicated interest in this option
prior to the start of the season, an insufficient number of students have
selected this option in order for it to be viable for us to offer it this year.
Those who selected the Sunday return option should have gotten a separate email
from me, and we will process refunds for the $75 add-on fees. Everyone who
selected the Sunday return option will instead have a bus seat returning home on
Saturday evening.

As a team, we continue to believe that the social components of ARML are a big
part of what makes this experience uniquely valuable, and we'll strive to
organize more activities that allow for those social interactions, both within
our teams and between students from other regions.

**A few reminders**
