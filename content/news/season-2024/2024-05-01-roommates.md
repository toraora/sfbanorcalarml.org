Dear ARML Team,

**Updated Roommate Form**

The University of Nevada Reno just informed us that we'll be staying in
different dorm rooms than last year, and the rooms will be triple occupancy
instead of double occupancy. We have the opportunity to update our roommate
pairings, but we need to get it done fast.

If you'd like to update your roommate preferences, you may resubmit the roommate
preference form by **9:00pm on Thursday (tomorrow)**. 
Requests should be mutual - all parties should request each other.
I will do my best to submit updated roommate pairings tomorrow night based on
the information that we've collected at that point.

[Submit your roommate preferences here.](https://forms.gle/KfR9CsAxP2rT6AoX6)
