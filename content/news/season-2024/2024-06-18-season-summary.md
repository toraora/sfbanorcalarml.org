Dear ARML Team,

Thank you to everyone who participated in our ARML team this year! We had
another great season, and after catching up on some sleep, I'm already
looking forward to next year's ARML season.

The [Contest Problems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hwc3NYPxPfyxxTLGTg9tzKqXWZQjx30/view) and [Final Results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AE4ZQnF34jSIfIjzbCoTqJVg3rVCJefA44Us9Wt8OPs/edit?pli=1) have been posted on ARML's website. Our A1 team finished 2nd nationally this year, and our A2 team finished in 14th place in Division A, as the second best A2 team in the country. Our regional teams finished with similar scores and placed at or near the top of the rankings for third, fourth, and fifth teams of organizations nationwide.

More importantly, it was wonderful to see so many of you at practices, at ARML
Local, and at the competition in Reno last weekend. To me, the community that we
build in our team every year is what ARML is really about.

Special shout-outs to: 
- Our coaches for organizing practices, coming to Reno, and being lots of fun.
- Zach and the rest of the Sac/Davis coaches for putting in a ton of work to
  organize the Sacramento branch of our team.
- Our parent chaperones for joining the trip and helping make everything run
  smoothly.
- AlphaStar Academy for partnering with us for ARML Power Contest and ARML
  Local, and for supporting our practice venues this year.
- All of the students, parents, and everyone else involved with the team for
  your contributions to our community.

team.
