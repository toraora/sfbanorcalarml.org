Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of updated logistics for our trip to Reno.  Please
read it carefully, even if you've already reviewed my previous messages. Let us
know if you have any questions.

### Itinerary

Our itinerary has been updated from my previous email, including a lot of
updated information from ARML's newly published program. We have also appointed
a "bus leader" at each location. Contact information for the bus leaders are now
listed in the itinerary. Don't print this out -- additional updates to the
itinerary are expected (this link will always take you to the latest version),
and printed copies of the latest itinerary will be distributed to all students
upon arrival in Reno.

We have also updated bus assignments based on the requests that we've received. 
Please see the end of this email for an updated roster and find your assigned
pickup location. If you'd like to board the bus at a different pickup location,
please reply to this email and let us know. We will try to accommodate such
requests within the constraints of capacity limits for our two buses.

### Alternate Transportation

For those of you traveling independently, you should see "parent" listed in the
table below. If this table is incorrect, please reply to this email and let us
know -- we need to get the roster right.

If you are traveling independently, you should plan to meet the following
drop-off and pickup times: 
- Friday May 31: Drop-off between 1:30pm and 2:00pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.
- Saturday June 1: Pickup between 3:15pm and 3:30pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.

If you are listed as traveling independently, I will be in touch via email on
Friday morning with a contact phone number for the staff member who will meet
you for the drop-off on Friday afternoon.

### Team and Coach Assignments

As mentioned in my previous updates, we needed to move some people around
between our regional teams in order to have teams of exactly 15 people each.
We have now done so, and everyone affected has been notified of their new team
assignments. The updated team lists are below. Students can join each team's
Discord channel by reacting in #roles (a server invite is available by clicking
on the Discord icon on the [team website](/)). 

Additionally, we have assigned at least two coaches/chaperones to each team.
These coaches are the primary contacts for each team during the trip, and will
be hosting all team meetings.  Contact information for team coaches are listed
at the end of the itinerary (linked above).

### Student Phone Numbers

Thank you to those who have already submitted a student cell phone number for
the trip. If you have not yet done so, please use the form below to report your
cell phone number. Note that this should be the number of a cell phone that
If you'll be carrying with you on the trip. If you will not have a cell phone on
the trip, please indicate that on the form.

### Permission Slips

Permission slips were sent a few days ago via Dropbox Sign to all parents, using
the parent email address that was submitted in the Information Sheet last month.
Thank you to the vast majority of you who have completed the paperwork. If you
have not yet completed the permission slip, please do so as soon as possible. No
student may attend ARML without a completed permission slip.

### Packing List Reminders

A few updates to the packing list:
- Please pack a snack or lunch with you on the bus. Due to our planned schedule
  this year, we will not be making a lunch stop, and food options are limited
  when we arrive on campus. As noted in the itinerary, an early dinner will be
  provided on campus.
- Toiletries will not be provided - you should pack shampoo. Linens will be
  provided, which includes sheets, towels, blankets, and pillow.
- For those returning to ARML, it is team tradition to wear your oldest ARML
  shirt on the bus. You'll see many of our coaches wearing shirts from when they
  participated in ARML as students. :)

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
