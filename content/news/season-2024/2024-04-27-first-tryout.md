Dear ARML Team,

**First Tryout**

Our first tryout will take place **tomorrow (Sunday), 4pm-5pm**.
We will hold this tryout on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/). 

If you have secured a spot on the team by registering and paying for ARML, your
ContestDojo account should have been updated to reflect membership in a team
called "Registered Students". If you see this team when you log
in, that means that you're set up correctly.

If you are not intending to travel with the team to Reno and have not paid ARML
fees, you're still welcome to participate in the tryout for extra
practice. If you'd like to participate, please create a _Student_ account on
ContestDojo if you do not have one yet, and reply to this email with the email
address of your ContestDojo account. We will authorize your account to
participate in the tryout as an unregistered student. Please note that you will
need to send in your information by 3:45pm in order to be able to start the
tryout on time.

At 4pm, we will open the tryout.  Click on the button "Click here to take your
tests", and you will be able to start the tryout. The tryout will consist of 10
problems in 5 pairs, 10 minute per pair. After each set, ContestDojo will
automatically advance you to the next pair, with no intervening pause. Please
note that you must start the tryout by 4:10pm in order to have the full time
allotted for the tryout -- starting later will result in having less total time.

Please treat the tryout as you would any contest. The tryout should represent
your own work, and you should not use outside resources. Do not use calculators
or other computing aids during the tryout. 

A note on elite team selection: While recommended, tryouts are not required for
elite team selection. We consider a wide variety of factors in team selection,
including contest scores. We encourage everyone to participate in tryouts,
regardless of interest in elite teams, since it's good extra practice. We will
have an additional tryout opportunity on Saturday, May 4. For details, see
http://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/.

**T-Shirt Designs**

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by tomorrow, April 28. Please
see [this post](/news/season-2024/2024-arml-information/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at info@sfbanorcalarml.org and we may be able to help.
