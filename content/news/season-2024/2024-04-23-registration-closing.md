Dear ARML Team,

**Registration and Payment Deadline**

Registration for our team closes today: Tuesday, April 23. We will need to
submit our final roster to ARML this week. If you are planning to come with
the team to Reno this year, we need you to register by the end of day today.
Registration consists of two steps:

1. Complete the [Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/UHXy2ULNBbcBiadm6). 
   If you are on our email list, you have already done this.
2. Pay the team fee on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/). We need to
   receive your payment in order to reserve your spot on the team.

For more information, please see [Joining the Team](/join/).

**Parent and Coach Volunteers**

If you are interested in joining us as a volunteer on the Reno trip as a coach
or parent chaperone, please make sure that you have filled out the
[Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/UHXy2ULNBbcBiadm6).
Those who have done so will receive an email tomorrow requesting additional
information -- you will have until Friday to respond to that email in order to
lock in your spot on the team.

**T-Shirt Designs**

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by April 28. Please see
[this post](/news/season-2024/2024-arml-information/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at {{ email() }} and we may be able to help.

**A few reminders**

All team information and announcements are posted on our [homepage](/).
If you have recently joined the team, you can go there to see an archive of old
emails and announcements. Students are invited to join our team's Discord server
by going to our website and clicking the Discord icon on the front page.

If you have any questions, you can reach out to our coaching staff at
{{ email() }}.

You'll hear from me a few more times this week as we work to finalize our
roster, and I'll also be in touch soon regarding tryouts and practices. :)
