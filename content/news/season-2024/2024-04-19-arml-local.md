Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of time-sensitive information about upcoming
activities and deadlines. Please read through it and email us at
{{ email() }} if you have any questions.

**ARML Local**

ARML Local is this weekend— it’s a great (and free!) opportunity to get a taste of ARML, meet the team, and participate in a low-stakes competition! We are hosting ARML Local in two times and places:

- Sunday, 4/21 @ 11am, Garden House, Shoup Park, Los Altos
- Sunday, 4/21 @ 2pm, UC Davis Shields Library Room 162

Please arrive on-time as we'll need to form teams on the spot for ARML Local. We expect the competition to take approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Registration and Payment Deadline**

Our registration and payment deadline for this year is April 23 (next Tuesday).
In order to reserve a spot on the team, you must complete the Information Sheet and pay the contest fee ($390) by this date. Please see [our website](/join/) for details. 

If you'd like to select the [Sunday morning return
option](/logistics/#new-for-2024-option-to-return-sunday-morning), you must reserve your
spot by [paying the $75
fee](/join/#35-optional-decide-whether-to-select-to-return-sunday-morning) by April 23.

For our planning, we greatly appreciate if you can submit your information sheet and payment as soon as possible, well in advance of the deadline.

**Parent and Coach Volunteers**

If you are a parent or coach who is interested in coming to Reno as a volunteer
this year, please fill out the [Information
Sheet](https://forms.gle/UHXy2ULNBbcBiadm6) as soon as possible. ARML requires
that we finalize our travel roster next week, including volunteers. Parent and
coach volunteers will asked to assist throughout the weekend, and will be
provided with a dorm room at UNR on Friday night (and Saturday night for those
staying through Sunday morning).

At the beginning of next week, we will reach out to all parents and coaches who
have completed the Information Sheet. In order to confirm a spot on the trip as
a volunteer, you will need to respond to the instructions provided in that
email.

**Sacramento**

If you live in the Sacramento area, there are weekly practices for your region,
both online and in-person at UC Davis. For more information about those
practices, please visit [our practice page](https://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/) or contact sacramento.math@gmail.com.

**T-Shirt Designs**

In a venerable ARML tradition, we'll be designing a distinctive team t-shirt.
You are invited to submit design ideas, and we will put them to a vote in early
May. Designs should be submitted by April 28. Please see [this post](/news/season-2024/2024-arml-information/) for more information.

**Action Items**

To summarize, here's what you should do right now if you're going to ARML this year:

- Come to ARML Local this weekend!

- Sign up for ARML! Fill out the Information Sheet and pay the fee on ContestDojo by April 23.

- Tell your friends to sign up for ARML too.

- If you want to submit a t-shirt design, start working on it and submit that by April 28.

We're looking forward to seeing everyone this weekend for ARML Local!
