Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of information about the travel logistics for our trip
to ARML in Reno on Friday and Saturday. Please read it carefully, and let us
know if you have any questions.

### Itinerary

Please read through the following itinerary for a detailed schedule, including
bus pickups, travel schedule, details about our time in Reno. We will send out
an updated version in a couple days with additional information. Note that some
of this information is based on last year's ARML program -- there may be some
minor adjustments when this year's ARML program becomes available.

The University of Nevada Reno's College of Engineering is hosting an activity on
Friday night. This activity is optional, and **pre-registration is required** to
participate. Go to https://admissions.unr.edu/register/ARML to register.
> Join UNR College of Engineering students to build Tall Towers. Participants will have to design and build a tower with given supplies, a limited "budget," and in a time limit. Please register by May 30 in order to participate.

Based on the information that we have available, we have assigned students to
bus pickup locations. Please see the end of this email for an updated roster and
find your assigned pickup location. If you'd like to board the bus at a
different pickup location, please reply to this email and let us know. We will
try to accommodate such requests within the constraints of capacity limits for
our two buses.

### Alternate Transportation

A number of you have asked about traveling independently with parents to ARML. 
In order to maintain supervision during the trip, we require that any student
traveling independently to be dropped off and picked up at UNR at designated
times. We anticipate these time intervals to be approximately a 1:30pm dropoff
on Friday and a 3pm pickup on Saturday, and we'll send an update soon with more
detailed instructions.

If we've already recorded your intention to travel independently, your travel in
the table below should be listed as "parent". If you're assigned to the bus but
plan to travel with parents, please reply to this email and let us know, so that
we're not looking for you when loading the buses.

### Student Phone Numbers

To make communication more efficient, we are collecting student cell phone
numbers for this trip. Please use the form below to report your cell phone
number. Note that this should be the number of a cell phone that you'll be
carrying with you on the trip. If you will not have a cell phone on the trip,
please indicate that on the form.

### Permission Forms

Permission forms were recently sent via HelloSign to all parents using the
parent email address that was submitted in the Information Sheet last month.
Please complete the paperwork as soon as possible. No student may attend ARML
without a completed permission form.

### Optional Homework

We have posted two individual rounds on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/)
as optional practice material. If you'd like to partake, you may complete those
individual rounds at any time on ContestDojo. Solutions can be found in the same
place as materials from practice:

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
