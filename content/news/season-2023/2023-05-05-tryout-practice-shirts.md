Dear ARML Team,

A couple events happening this weekend for the team:

**Second Tryout**

Our second tryout will take place **tomorrow (Saturday), 3pm-4pm**. 
The tryout will be held on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/), just like
the previous tryout. We will open the tryout at 3pm.  Please note that you must
start the tryout by 3:10pm in order to have the full time allotted for the
tryout. For more information about the tryout, see 
[my previous email](/news/season-2023/first-tryout/).

**First SFBA Practice**

Our first SFBA practice will take place in Palo Alto on **Sunday, noon to 5pm**,
at Cubberley Community Center. The details are on the [practice
website](/practices/).
At this first practice, we will introduce the coaches, announce this year's
elite teams, introduce each of the ARML rounds, and practice in teams. 
We encourage everyone to carpool to practice with others from your city or area.

ARML is a team event, and it's important that everyone come to practice if
possible in order to work in teams. If you have a schedule conflict with part of
practice, it's ok to attend whatever portion that you're available. If you're
unable to attend, please fill out our
[practice absence form](https://forms.gle/2ZYCyVhNGnKx5vY5A) and provide a
(good) reason. If you are not joining the team on the trip to Reno this year,
you're still welcome to come to practice - just make sure to check in with a
coach when you arrive so we can tell you which team to practice with. If you're
in the Sacramento/Davis area, you're not required or expected to come to SFBA's
practices; instead, please attend the practice at UC Davis.

**T-Shirt Poll**

We have received 3 t-shirt designs. Please vote for your preferred design on our
[T-Shirt
Poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch9tnBx2cE6eceu4IsnakzgpYtlFRx_HIxln5txUDCn7IlPg/viewform). We will close the vote at end of the day on Monday, May 8.
