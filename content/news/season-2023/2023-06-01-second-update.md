Dear ARML Team,

We have made a few final adjustments to the itinerary, and the latest version
is in the link below. The main change is that we've swapped some coach
assignments between different teams, especially A4. A printed copy of this
document will be given to every student and chaperone upon arrival in Reno.

At the end of this email is an updated list of bus group assignments reflecting
all of the changes that I've recorded over the past day. Please verify your
information, and continue to let me know if you need to make changes (for
example, if you are traveling independently and have not yet emailed me, I need
to know ASAP).

As a reminder, if you have not yet provided your cell phone number for the trip,
please do so on the [Student Cell Phone Number Form](https://forms.gle/W9Cf4edYXfAyVA1A6).

If you missed any previous information that we've provided in the past few days,
emails are archived on the [website](/) for you to review.
