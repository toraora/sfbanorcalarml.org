Dear ARML Team,

**Registration and Payment Deadline**

Registration for our team closes tomorrow: Tuesday, April 25. We will need to
submit our final roster to ARML this week. If you are planning to come on with
the team to Reno this year, we need you to register by tomorrow. Registration
consists of two steps:

1. Complete the [Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/aRn5qh9frHUZEno56). 
   If you are on our email list, you have already done this.
2. Pay the team fee on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/). We need to
   receive your payment in order to reserve your spot on the team.

For more information, please see [Joining the Team](https://sfbanorcalarml.org/join/).

**Parent and Coach Volunteers**

All parents and coaches who have filled out the Information Sheet expressing
interest in joining us as a volunteer on the Reno trip should have received an
email requesting additional information. If you have not received this email,
please let us know at arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu.

If you have not yet done so but are interested in volunteering for ARML, please
make sure that you fill out the [Information
Sheet](https://forms.gle/aRn5qh9frHUZEno56) as soon as possible, and we will
reach out with additional information.

**T-Shirt Designs**

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by April 30. Please see
[this post](/news/season-2023/2023-arml-information/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu and we may be able to help.

**A few reminders**

All team information and announcements are posted at on our [homepage](/).
If you have recently joined the team, you can go there to see an archive of old
emails and announcements. 

If you have any questions, you can reach out to our coaching staff at
arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu.

You'll hear from me a few more times this week as we work to finalize our
roster, and I'll also be in touch soon regarding tryouts and practices. :)
