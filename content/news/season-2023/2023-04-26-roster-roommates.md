Dear ARML Team,

**Roster Check**

At the bottom of this email is the list of all students who are fully registered
and have a confirmed spot on our team. If you think that you're registered,
please look for your name in the list below. In case of any errors or changes,
get in touch with us as soon as possible so we can make corrections before
submitting this list to ARML.

**Roommate Form**

Now that our roster is pretty much set, we're giving everyone a chance to update
roommate requests. This form is due at noon on Friday, and we'll do our best to
accommodate requests that we receive by then. Requests must be mutual - both
parties need to request each other. Note that we will likely be required to
separate students over 18 and under 18 in the roommate assignments.

[Submit your roommate preferences here.](https://forms.gle/ZPbUYWF7chu7U2xY8)

**Upcoming Events**

We will hold elite team tryouts online on Zoom on April 30 and May 6. The Bay
Area teams will hold practices on May 7, 13, and 20, while Sacramento will
continue to hold weekly practices as well. The details are available at
https://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/.

In the coming week, we will also reach out regarding transportation and
permission slips. By default, everyone's transportation will be a bus seat
provided by the team. If you're considering traveling to ARML independently with
your parents, we will have information for you soon. (In short, we will
designate a drop-off time on Friday and a pick-up time on Saturday, and ask all
independent travelers to comply with those times.) We will also send out
permission slips to parents next week for digital signatures.

**T-Shirt Designs**

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by April 30. Please see
[this post](/news/season-2023/2023-arml-information/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu and we may be able to help.
