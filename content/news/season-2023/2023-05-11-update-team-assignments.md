Dear ARML Team,

It was great to see everyone at practice last Sunday, and I enjoyed closing our
practice with an ice cream social.

A few brief updates for this week, including an action item that's
**due today**.

### Team Assignments

We announced the roster for this year's two elite teams (A1 and A2) on Sunday.
Those teams are listed below. With all of the talent that we have on our team,
it was quite a difficult decision.

This year, we'll split our remaining teams into four groups, called A3 through
A6. These teams are not ranked, and will be divided regionally by default, with
A3 being our Sacramento-area team. We plan to announce our regional teams at
this weekend's practice, and to practice in those teams on Saturday.

We're opening a limited time opportunity for students on regional teams to
request teammates. If you are on a regional team, you may submit a request by
end-of-day Thursday (today) to be placed on a team with specific other students.
While it might not be possible to fulfill every such request, we intend to honor
these requests as much as possible in the selection process.

Additionally, as we currently have 84 students on our roster, our A6 team will
not be a complete team. This year, we're partnering with Washington ARML to
combine our A6 team with their partial team in order to form a full team at the
ARML competition in Reno. Washington ARML is currently led by Jeff Soesbe, who
was our long-time Sacramento coach until 2021, and Arpit Ranasaria, a Stanford
student who also coaches at our SFBA practices, and I think this will be a fun
opportunity.

For those of you who are unable to attend our in-person practices or are
otherwise busy, we have a special offer associated with our A6 team. We will
organize joint online practices on Sunday afternoons with our A6 team and
Washington's A3 team. While students who choose this option are of course still
welcome to attend in-person SFBA practices, they will not be required to do so,
and will not need to submit absence forms. If this option appeals to you, please
let us know.

Both for requesting teammates for the regional teams, and to request a spot on
SFBA / NorCal A6, please complete the following form by **end of day Thursday
(today)**:

### Second SFBA Practice

Our second SFBA practice will take place in Cupertino on **Saturday, noon to 5pm**,
at Random Math's offices. The details are on the [practice
website](/practices/). Like this past weekend, we'll spend the last 45 minutes
of practice doing something fun to help everyone meet each other.
We encourage everyone to carpool to practice with others from your city or area.

As we've mentioned previously, practice is an important part of ARML, and we ask
that team members come to as much of the practices as possible. For SFBA
students, if you're unable to attend, please fill out our
[practice absence form](https://forms.gle/2ZYCyVhNGnKx5vY5A) and provide a
(good) reason. Examples of good reasons include health issues and conflicting
events; we generally discourage using studying for exams as a reason to miss
practice. If you don't have time to come to in-person practices, we encourage
you to consider choosing to participate on the A6 team.

### Practice Materials

Practice materials from our first practice have now been posted. Note that
each team at practice covered different material -- if your team hasn't covered
something yet, please don't review it on your own, as your team will likely use
this material at our next practice.

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
