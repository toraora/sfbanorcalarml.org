date: 2023-05-17

Dear ARML Team,

Thanks to those who came to practice this past weekend, and hope your week is
going well.

### Extra Shirts

At practice, teams voted on their team colors, and the following colors were
selected:
- Coach: Tie-Dye
- A1: Light Pink
- A2: Antique Irish Green
- A3: Orchid
- A4: Mint Green
- A5: Black
- A6: Gold

Everyone on the team (including coaches and parent chaperones) will receive a
team t-shirt based on the size that you submitted on your information sheet.
There is no need to request a shirt. If you need to change the size of the shirt
that you ordered, please get in touch with us as soon as possible at
arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu.

We are opening a limited time opportunity to buy an *additional* shirt, perhaps
if you'd like a shirt of a different color, for example. If you'd like to
purchase an extra shirt, you may do so at the following link. This opportunity
closes at end of today (Wednesday, May 17).

[**Order an *extra* shirt here.**](https://buy.stripe.com/28og2gaBJcSE4zSbII)

When ordering an extra shirt, please specify the color and size of your shirts
(e.g. Coach S; A1 M; Mint Green L).

### Final SFBA Practice

Our final SFBA practice will take place in Cupertino on **Saturday, noon to
5pm**, at Random Math's offices. The details are on the [practice
website](/practices/). At this weekend's practice, in addition to the usual
content, we're also going to participate in FARML, which is written by one of
the ARML authors as an annual practice scrimmage - we'll be competing against
other teams from across the country. As such, we'd appreciate if everyone could
make an extra effort to come on time. For SFBA students, if you're unable to
attend, please fill out our
[practice absence form](https://forms.gle/2ZYCyVhNGnKx5vY5A) and provide a
(good) reason. 

### Team Assignments

At this past weekend's practice, we announced preliminary assignments for the
regional teams. Since then, we have made a small number of additional
adjustments, mostly regarding the composition of the A6 team. An updated team
assignment list is provided below. Additional minor adjustments will likely be
required in subsequent weeks.

### Practice Materials

Practice materials from our second practice have now been posted. Note that
each team at practice covered different material -- if your team hasn't covered
something yet, please don't review it on your own, as your team will likely use
this material at our next practice.

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
