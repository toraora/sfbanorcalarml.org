Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of time-sensitive information about upcoming
activities and deadlines. Please read through it and email us at
arml-info@lists.berkeley.edu if you have any questions.

**ARML Local**

ARML Local is this weekend— it’s a great (and free!) opportunity to get a taste of ARML, meet the team, and participate in a low-stakes competition! We are hosting ARML Local in two times and places:

- Saturday, 4/22 @ 1 PM, Grant Park Community Center Multipurpose Room in Los Altos
- Sunday, 4/23 @ 4 PM, UC Davis MSB 2112

Please plan to attend exactly one administration; testing should conclude in at most 4 hours. If you do not attend Sacramento team practices and plan to attend ARML Local at UCD, please inform sacramento.math@gmail.com of your intention.

**Registration and Payment Deadline**

Our registration and payment deadline for this year is April 25 (next Tuesday).
In order to reserve a spot on the team, you must complete the Information Sheet and pay the contest fee ($440) by this date. Please see [our website](https://sfbanorcalarml.org/join/) for details. 

For our planning with the compressed timeframe this year, we greatly appreciate if you can submit your information sheet and payment as soon as possible, well in advance of the deadline.

**Parent and Coach Volunteers**

If you are a parent or coach who is interested in coming to Reno as a volunteer
this year, please fill out the [Information
Sheet](https://forms.gle/aRn5qh9frHUZEno56) as soon as possible. ARML requires
that we finalize our travel roster by the middle of next week, including
volunteers. Parent and coach volunteers will asked to assist throughout the
weekend, and will be provided with a dorm room at UNR on Friday night.

This weekend, we will reach out to all parents and coaches who have completed
the Information Sheet. In order to confirm a spot on the trip as a volunteer,
you will need to respond to the instructions provided in that email.

**Sacramento**

If you live in the Sacramento area, there are weekly practices for your region,
both online and in-person at UC Davis. For more information about those
practices, please visit [our practice page](https://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/) or contact sacramento.math@gmail.com.

**T-Shirt Designs**

In a venerable ARML tradition, we'll be designing a distinctive team t-shirt.
You are invited to submit design ideas, and we will put them to a vote in early
May. Designs should be submitted by April 30. Please see [this post](/news/season-2023/2023-arml-information/) for more information.

**Action Items**

To summarize, here's what you should do right now if you're going to ARML this year:

- Come to ARML Local this weekend!

- Sign up for ARML! Fill out the Information Sheet and pay the fee on ContestDojo by April 25th.

- Tell your friends to sign up for ARML too.

- If you want to submit a t-shirt design, start working on it and submit that by April 30th.

We're looking forward to seeing everyone this weekend for ARML Local!

PS: A note from Arpit at Mustang Math, who's also one of our coaches this year:

If you're a high schooler who has an interest in mathematics, consider volunteering at the Mustang Math Tournament 2023 at Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California on 4/29. Mustang Math is a competition organized by high school and college students like yourself, and the contest is for local middle schoolers! We have almost 200 students participating, and your help will make the contest a success! 

By volunteering, you will get a t-shirt, lunch, and volunteer hours if you'd like them, and also the satisfaction of being a part of such a wonderful event! You can sign up at https://tinyurl.com/MMT2023CAVolunteer !
