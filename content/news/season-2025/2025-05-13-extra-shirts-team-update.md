title: "Extra Shirts, Team Update"
date: 2025-05-13

Dear ARML Team,

Thanks to those who came to practice this past weekend! We're looking forward to
seeing everyone at our final practice this Saturday.

### Extra Shirts

At practice, teams voted on their team colors, and the following colors were
selected:
- Coach: Tie-Dye
- A1: Light Pink
- A2: Cardinal Red
- A3: Galapagos Blue
- A4: Pistachio
- A5: Royal
- A6: Mint Green

Everyone on the travel roster (including coaches and parent chaperones) will
receive a team t-shirt based on the size that you submitted on your information
sheet. There is no need to request a shirt. If you need to change the size of
the shirt that you ordered, please get in touch with us as soon as possible
at info@sfbanorcalarml.org.

We are opening a limited time opportunity to buy an *additional* shirt, perhaps
if you want a shirt of a different color, for example. If you'd like to
purchase an extra shirt, you may do so at the following link. This opportunity
closes at the end of day on Wednesday, May 14.

[**Order an *extra* shirt here.**](/news/season-2025/2025-extra-shirts/)

When ordering an extra shirt, please specify the color and size of your shirts
on the order form (e.g. Coach S; A1 M; Galapagos Blue L).

### Final Bay Area Practice

Our final Bay Area practice will take place in San Jose on **Saturday, noon to
5pm**, at [Bliss and Wisdom Foundation of Northern California](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n1exw4G9n4uY2VgVA). The details are on the
[practice website](/practices/#schedule). At this weekend's practice, in addition to the
usual content, we're also going to participate in FARML, which is written by one
of the ARML authors as an annual practice scrimmage - we'll be competing against
other teams from across the country. As such, we'd appreciate if everyone could
make an extra effort to come on time. For Bay Area students, if you're unable to
attend, please fill out our [practice absence
form](https://forms.gle/KXM5Sh6rF5qNfAxW6) and provide a (good) reason. 

### Team Assignments

At this past weekend's practice, we announced preliminary assignments for the
regional teams. Since then, we have made a small number of additional
adjustments to our team rosters. An updated team assignment list is provided
below. Additional adjustments will be required in subsequent weeks, especially
in rebalancing the sizes of the regional teams.

### Practice Materials and Homework

Practice materials from our second Bay Area practice have now been posted. Note
that each team at practice covered different material -- if your team hasn't
covered something yet, please don't review it on your own, as your team will
likely use this material at our next practice.

We have posted another individual round on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/) as optional practice material. If you'd
like to partake, you may complete this individual round at any time on
ContestDojo, and we'll continue to post additional individual rounds weekly
throughout the month.

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
