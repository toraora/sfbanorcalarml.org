Dear ARML Team,

A printed copy of the following itinerary will be given to every student and
chaperone upon arrival in Reno.

[**Updated 2025 ARML Itinerary**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgCL6ZY-gL0DPXI5GkXCnleaYOG9eMIm/view?usp=sharing)

At the end of this email is an updated list of bus group assignments reflecting
all of the changes that I've recorded over the past day. Please verify your
information, and continue to let me know if you need to make changes. For
example, if you are traveling independently and have not yet emailed me, I need
to know ASAP. If another bus pickup location is more convenient for you, we
*might* be able to swap your bus group, but we need to know *before* you show
up at the bus.

As a reminder, if you have not yet provided your cell phone number for the trip,
please do so on the 
[**Student Cell Phone Number Form**](https://forms.gle/a5sMBWxExHr4fAjD8).

If you missed any previous information that we've provided in the past few days,
emails are archived on the [website](/) for you to review.

Other documents that you may wish to review prior to the trip:
