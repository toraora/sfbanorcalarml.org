Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of updated logistics for our trip to Reno.  Please
read it carefully, even if you've already reviewed my previous messages. Let us
know if you have any questions.

### Itinerary

Our itinerary has been updated from my previous email, including coach
assignments. We have also assigned a "bus leader" at each location. Contact
information for the bus leaders are now listed in the itinerary. Don't print
this out -- additional updates to the itinerary are expected (this link will
always take you to the latest version), and printed copies of the latest
itinerary will be distributed to all students upon arrival in Reno.

We have also updated bus assignments based on the requests that we've received. 
Please see the end of this email for an updated roster and find your assigned
pickup location. If you'd like to board the bus at a different pickup location,
please reply to this email and let us know. We will try to accommodate such
requests within the constraints of capacity limits for our two buses.

### Alternate Transportation

For those of you traveling independently, you should see "parent" listed in the
table below. If this table is incorrect, please reply to this email and let us
know -- we need to get the roster right.

If you are traveling independently, you should plan to meet the following
drop-off and pickup times: 
- Friday May 31: Drop-off between 1:30pm and 2:00pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.
- Saturday June 1: Pickup between 3:15pm and 3:30pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.

If you are listed as traveling independently, I will be in touch via email on
Friday morning with a contact phone number for the staff member who will meet
you for the drop-off on Friday afternoon.

### Team and Coach Assignments

We have made additional small adjustments to regional team assignments over the
past several days, and additional small adjustments may be needed prior to
arrival at ARML. The current updated team lists are below. Students can join
each team's Discord channel by reacting in #roles (a server invite is available
by clicking on the Discord icon on the [team website](/)). 

Additionally, we have assigned at least two coaches/chaperones to each team.
These coaches are the primary contacts for each team during the trip, and will
be hosting all team meetings.  Contact information for team coaches are listed
at the end of the itinerary (linked above).

### Student Phone Numbers

Thank you to those who have already submitted a student cell phone number for
the trip. If you have not yet done so, please use the form below to report your
cell phone number. Note that this should be the number of a cell phone that
If you'll be carrying with you on the trip. If you will not have a cell phone on
the trip, please indicate that on the form.

### Packing List Reminders

Highlighting a few notes from the packing list:
- Please pack a snack or lunch with you on the bus. Due to our planned schedule
  this year, we will not be making a lunch stop, and food options are limited
  when we arrive on campus. As noted in the itinerary, an early dinner will be
  provided on campus.
- Toiletries will not be provided - you should pack soap, shampoo, etc. Linens
  will be provided, which includes sheets, towels, blankets, and pillow.
- For those returning to ARML, it is team tradition to wear your oldest ARML
  shirt on the bus. You'll see many of our coaches wearing shirts from when they
  participated in ARML as students. :)

Reno is dry and this weekend is expected to be HOT in Reno (94-95 F) but it will be cooler in the morning and in the evening (60 F). Make sure to bring a water bottle (refilling stations are present throughout campus).

This is ARML's 50th year, so there will be 50th anniversary playing cards ($10), glow-in-the-dark frisbees ($10), ARML mugs ($5), and books (most are $5 but newer ones are $30) available for purchase at the ARML Store on Saturday. Cash, checks, credit cards, and Apple Pay accepted.

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
