### What is ARML Local?

ARML Local is a "mini-ARML", written by ARML's problem writers. Teams will be
ranked nationally and winners will be recognized at the awards ceremony in Reno
on May 31.

For information about the competition, you can review the
[ARML Local Competitor
Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13cjIKZnKJ4sSFFN5GQiMmi_aHoRGiYq_xozj_OQcrl8/).

### How do I participate?

We are hosting ARML Local in two times and places:
- *Bay Area:* Sunday, 4/27 @ 9am, Bliss and Wisdom Foundation, San Jose
- *Sacramento Area:* Sunday, 4/27 @ 12pm, UC Davis Shields Library Room 162

There is no need to register in advance, though we do ask that you come on-time.
The competition will take approximately 4 hours to complete. Our target end time
in the Bay Area is 1pm.

### How are teams formed?

Please be prompt as we'll need to form teams on the spot for ARML Local. We'll
ask everyone to sign in upon arrival and coordinate team formation. 
Feel free to bring friends if you have anyone who you'd like on your team.

### What if I have a time conflict?

You don't have to participate in ARML Local in order to compete with us in Reno
at ARML. We do treat ARML Local as a tryout opportunity, but we will have other
tryout opportunities, and you're not required to attend every tryout. For
information about tryouts, see our [Practices](/practices/) page.

On the flip side, you're welcome to attend ARML Local even if you can't make it
to ARML. 

### What can parents do during ARML Local?

For those of you coming to San Jose, you're not required to stick around,
though we may be able to set out some tables/chairs if you need a place to stay.
I'll also be available to answer any questions that you have about ARML.

In order for us to be most efficient, we could also use a few volunteers to help
us distribute test papers and proctor the competition. If you're available to
help, please let us know when you arrive, and we'd really appreciate your help.

Please email us at info@sfbanorcalarml.org if you have any additional questions.
