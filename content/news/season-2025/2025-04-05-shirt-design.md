title: "Shirt Design Contest (Due April 30)"

In a venerable ARML tradition, we'll be designing a distinctive team t-shirt. You are invited to submit design ideas, and we will put them to a vote in early May. Here are the rules:

- T-shirt designs must be submitted by April 30th.

- All designs MUST be submitted in a vector-graphics format such as .svg or .ai. (Inkscape is free software that can create such files and is decently easy to use.)

- Designs consist of a front and a back (make a separate file for each).

- To keep printing costs low, you may use at most four colors of ink TOTAL between the front and the back: either 4 colors on one side and the other side blank, 3 colors on one side and 1 on the other, or 2 colors on each side. You are not required to use four colors; some past designs have just been simple white line art on each side.

- The design will most likely be printed on shirts of several different fabric colors. It is best if you design something that works against a variety of background colors. In our experience, white line art usually does well across a wide range of colors.

- Do not use anything offensive or anyone else's copyrighted material.

- *New for 2025*: Do not use any AI-generated designs or design elements.

Send your designs to info@sfbanorcalarml.org by April 30th. If you would like help with your design, send it in at least a week early, and we will do our best to help improve it.
