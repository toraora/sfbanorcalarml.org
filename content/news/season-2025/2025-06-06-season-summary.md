Dear ARML Team,

Thank you to everyone who participated in our ARML team this year! We had
another great season, and after catching up on some sleep, I'm already
looking forward to next year's ARML season.

The [Contest Problems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqZg0F5VV3iAVWAR3OWMWceL9cggBd1q/view?usp=drive_link) and [Final Results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KQYnstIYxyz2r1KoyYIbkl-2Ex62jd1x-Cy-z8BcG8/edit?usp=sharing) have been posted on ARML's website. Our A1 team finished 2nd nationally this year, and our A2 team finished in 12th place in Division A, as the best A2 team in the country.

More importantly, it was wonderful to see so many of you at practices, at ARML
Local, and at the competition in Reno last weekend.  As I mentioned during our
final team meeting prior to leaving campus, we had a historically young team
this year, and I have a lot of optimism for the future development of our team
and community -- and to me, that community is really what ARML is all about.

Special shout-outs to: 
- Neal for stepping up and taking over the Sac / Davis branch of our team when
  we needed a new coach this year.
- All of our coaches who came to practices and worked with our students
  throughout the season.
- Our parent chaperones who took time off work and volunteered their weekends to
  come to ARML and make everything run so smoothly.
- Everyone on our teams for being integral parts of our community.

Our ARML team is an all-volunteer effort. Your registration fees go directly
toward the contest fee, transportation, dorm rooms, practices, and the team
t-shirt, and are barely sufficient to cover costs. We'd love to be able to do
even more next year, and if you'd like to give to our team, you may do so at the
following link: https://sfbanorcalarml.org/donate/. We are a
registered 501(c)(3) organization and contributions are tax-deductible.

Please stay in touch! Students are encouraged to join the team Discord server
-- click on the Discord icon on our [website](/) to join. I hope that we'll see
many of you at events throughout the coming year, and as a part of next year's
team.
