Dear ARML Team,

### Registration and Payment Deadline

Registration for our team closes today: Monday, April 28. This is a firm
deadline to comply with ARML's registration requirements.  If you are planning
to come with the team to Reno this year, we need you to register by the end of
day today. Registration consists of two steps:

1. Complete the [Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A). 
   If you are on our email list, you have already done this.
2. Pay the team fee on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/). We need to
   receive your payment in order to reserve your spot on the team.

For more information, please see [Joining the Team](/join/).

### Parent and Coach Volunteers

If you are interested in joining us as a volunteer on the Reno trip as a coach
or parent chaperone, please make sure that you have filled out the
[Information Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A).
Those who have done so will receive a follow-up email requesting additional
information. You must respond to that email by the end of day today in order to
lock in your spot on the team.

### T-Shirt Designs

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by April 30. Please see
[this post](/news/season-2025/shirt-design/) for more information.
If you have a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please
send that idea to us at info@sfbanorcalarml.org and we may be able to help.

### A few reminders

All team information and announcements are posted at http://sfbanorcalarml.org/.
If you have recently joined the team, you can go there to see an archive of old
emails and announcements. Students are invited to join our team's Discord server
by going to our website and clicking the Discord icon on the front page.

If you have any questions, you can reach out to our coaching staff at
info@sfbanorcalarml.org.

You'll hear from me a few more times this week as we work to finalize our
roster, and I'll also be in touch soon regarding practices. :)
