Dear ARML Team,

It was great to see everyone at practice last Sunday, and I enjoyed closing our
practice with an ice cream social.

A few updates for this week, including a couple action items:

### Team Assignments

We announced the roster for this year's two elite teams (A1 and A2) on Sunday.
Those teams are listed below. As always, with all of the talent that we have on
our team, it was quite a difficult decision.

We will split our remaining teams into groups of 15 students. These
teams are not ranked, and will be divided regionally by default. We plan to
announce our regional teams at this weekend's practice, and to practice in those
teams on Saturday.

We're opening a limited time opportunity for students on regional teams to
request teammates. If you are on a regional team, you may submit a request by
end-of-day Thursday (today) to be placed on a team with specific other students.
While it might not be possible to fulfill every such request, we intend to honor
these requests as much as possible in the selection process.

Please note that practice attendance is a factor in both elite team placement
and selection of alternates; see the [Policies](/policies/) for more
information. In particular, elite team members who miss practices may be removed
from their teams, and we will select alternates during the week prior to the
competition based primarily on practice attendance.

If you'd like to request teammates, please complete the following form by **end
of day Thursday (today)**:

### Second Bay Area Practice

Our second Bay Area practice will take place on **Saturday, noon to 5pm** at
**Willow Glen Community Center** in San Jose.
The details are on the [practice website](/practices/#schedule).
Like this past weekend, we'll spend the last 45 minutes
of practice doing something fun to help everyone meet each other.
We encourage everyone to carpool to practice with others from your city or area.

For Bay Area students, if you're unable to attend, please fill out our [practice
absence form](https://forms.gle/KXM5Sh6rF5qNfAxW6) and provide a (good) reason.
Examples of good reasons include health issues and conflicting events; we
discourage using studying for exams as a reason to miss practice.

### Practice Materials and Optional Homework

Practice materials from our tryouts and the first Bay Area practice have now
been posted. Note that each team at practice covers different material -- if
your team hasn't covered something yet, please don't review it on your own, as
your team will likely use this material at our next practice.

We have posted an individual round on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/)
as optional practice material. If you'd like to partake, you may complete this
individual round at any time on ContestDojo. We'll post additional individual
rounds weekly throughout the month. These individual rounds are auto-graded, and
coaches will not review your submissions or look at your scores -- this is
purely for yourself. Solutions can be found at the same practice materials link.

### T-Shirt Poll

We have received two t-shirt designs, each with two options.
Please vote for your preferred design by **3pm Friday**. The winning
design will be announced at practice on Saturday, and teams will vote on their
preferred shirt colors.

### Transportation

We will provide transportation to Reno for all traveling students and
chaperones. Everyone traveling will be assigned a pickup time
and location, departing at around 8am on May 30 and returning at around 8pm on
May 31. Pickup and dropoff locations this year are anticipated to be the same as
last year, in San Jose, Palo Alto, San Ramon, and Davis.

A number of you have asked about traveling independently with parents to ARML. 
In order to maintain supervision during the trip, we require that any student
traveling independently to be dropped off and picked up at UNR at designated
times. We anticipate these time intervals to approximately a 1:30pm dropoff
on Friday and a 3pm pickup on Saturday. If you are intending to travel
independently, please let me know, so I can record this information prior to
making bus assignments.


As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
