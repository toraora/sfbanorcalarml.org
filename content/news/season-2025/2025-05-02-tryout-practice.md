Dear ARML Team,

A couple events happening this weekend for the team:

### Second Tryout

Our second tryout will take place **tomorrow (Saturday), 11am-12pm**.
The tryout will be held on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/), just like
the previous tryout. We will open the tryout at 11am.  Please note that you must
start the tryout by 11:10am in order to have the full time allotted for the
tryout. For more information about the tryout, see 
[our tryout page](/news/season-2025/2025-tryouts/).

### First Bay Area Practice

Our first Bay Area practice will take place in San Jose on **Sunday, noon to
5pm**, at [Bliss and Wisdom
Foundation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n1exw4G9n4uY2VgVA). The details are on our
[Practices](/practices/#schedule) page.
At this first practice, we will introduce the coaches, announce this year's
elite teams, introduce each of the ARML rounds, and practice in teams. 
We encourage everyone to carpool to practice with others from your city or area.

ARML is a team event, and it's important that everyone come to practice if
possible in order to work in teams. If you have a schedule conflict with part of
practice, it's ok to attend whatever portion that you're available. If you're
unable to attend, please fill out our
[practice absence form](https://forms.gle/KXM5Sh6rF5qNfAxW6) and provide a
(good) reason. Practice attendance is a factor in both elite team placement and
selection of alternates; see the [Policies](/policies/) for more
information.

If you are not joining the team on the trip to Reno this year,
you're still welcome to come to practice - just make sure to check in with a
coach when you arrive so we can tell you which team to practice with. If you're
in the Sacramento/Davis area, you're not required or expected to come to Bay
Area practices; instead, please attend [the practice at UC Davis](/sac/).

Looking forward to seeing many of you this weekend!
