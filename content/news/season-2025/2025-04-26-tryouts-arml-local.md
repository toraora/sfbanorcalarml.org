Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of time-sensitive information about upcoming
activities and deadlines. Please read through it and email us at
{{ email() }} if you have any questions.

### First Online Tryout

Our first tryout will take place **today (Saturday), 4pm-5pm**.
We will hold this tryout on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/). 

Please see our [Tryouts post](/news/season-2025/2025-tryouts/) for more information about today's tryout, including some FAQs.

In particular, if you have secured a spot on the team by registering and paying
for ARML, your ContestDojo account should be set up for today's online tryout.
If you have not done so, we can give you guest access to the tryout, but you'll
need to email us no later than 3:45pm to request access for the email address
associated with your ContestDojo account.

Please treat the tryout as you would any contest. The tryout should represent
your own work, and you should not use outside resources. Do not use calculators
or other computing aids during the tryout. 

### ARML Local

ARML Local is tomorrow (Sunday) -- it’s a great (and free!) opportunity to get a taste of ARML, meet the team, and participate in a low-stakes competition! We are hosting ARML Local in both the Bay Area and at UC Davis.

- Sunday, 4/27 @ 9am, Bliss and Wisdom Foundation of Northern California, San Jose
- Sunday, 4/27 @ 12pm, UC Davis Shields Library Room 162

Please arrive on-time as we'll need to form teams on the spot for ARML Local. We expect the competition to take approximately 4 hours to complete.

Please see our [ARML Local post](/news/season-2025/2025-arml-local/) for more information about ARML Local, including some FAQs.

### Registration and Payment Deadline

Our registration and payment deadline for this year is April 28 (Monday).
In order to reserve a spot on the team, you must complete the Information Sheet and pay the contest fee ($390) by this date. Please see [our website](/join/) for details. 

For our planning, we greatly appreciate it if you can submit your information sheet and payment as soon as possible, in advance of the deadline.

### Parent and Coach Volunteers

If you are a parent or coach who is interested in coming to Reno as a volunteer
this year, please fill out the [Information
Sheet](https://forms.gle/q7zA1AZEEsZDDnC6A) as soon as possible. ARML requires
that we finalize our travel roster next week, including volunteers. Parent and
coach volunteers will be asked to assist throughout the trip, and will be
provided with a dorm room at UNR.

This weekend, we will reach out to all parents and coaches who
have completed the Information Sheet. In order to confirm a spot on the trip as
a volunteer, you will need to respond to the instructions provided in that
email by the end of day on Monday.

### Sacramento

If you live in the Sacramento area, there are weekly practices for your region at UC Davis. For more information about those
practices, please visit [Sacramento page](https://sfbanorcalarml.org/sac/) or contact {{ email(name="sac") }}

### T-Shirt Designs

In a venerable ARML tradition, we'll be designing a distinctive team t-shirt.
You are invited to submit design ideas, and we will put them to a vote in early
May. Designs should be submitted by April 30. Please see [this post](/news/season-2025/shirt-design/) for more information.

### Action Items

To summarize, here's what you should do right now if you're going to ARML this year:

- Participate in our online tryout on Saturday (today)!

- Come to ARML Local on Sunday (tomorrow)!

- Sign up for ARML! Fill out the Information Sheet and pay the fee on ContestDojo by April 28.

- Tell your friends to sign up for ARML too.
