Dear ARML Team,

Welcome to ARML 2025! This email is going out to everyone who participated in the SFBA/NorCal ARML Team last year, as well as anyone else we think might be interested in joining the team for 2025. It contains a LOT of information about the logistics, timing, and details of this year's ARML competition, as well as several action items for you.

**How to Sign Up**

If you're planning on going to ARML this year, you'll need to complete two steps by end of day on April 28. Those steps are laid out on our website at http://sfbanorcalarml.org/join/.

As a summary: First, fill out the Information Sheet – you can do this even if you're not sure you want to go to Reno; it just gets you on our email list so you can stay informed. Second, once you're sure you're going, pay the fee on ContestDojo. Similar to last year, we'll handle permission slips via electronic signatures in May. All the details you need about ARML this year can be found at https://sfbanorcalarml.org/.

**Practice Schedule**

Check out our [Season Calendar](/news/season-2025/2025-calendar/) for the full schedule.

We will hold an online info session for those new to ARML on April 16
at 6pm. Register for the info session at https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/zRV2XvwZTWCWXAZyUqhteg to receive the Zoom link.

In addition, we will hold ARML Local on Sunday, April 27, tentatively 9am-1pm in
San Jose. Everyone is welcome to attend ARML Local, regardless of whether you're
planning to come to Reno with the team. No fees are
required for ARML Local.

We will hold two online elite team tryouts on April 26 and May 3. We will
also consider ARML Local as a tryout opportunity. While attending these
activities is optional, we highly encourage attending at least one tryout for
anyone interested in being selected for an elite team.

Like last year, we will hold three practices on weekends in May. Each practice
will include time to work in teams, as well as some fun math activities for
everyone to get to know each other. The details are all available at
https://sfbanorcalarml.org/practices/. We are still working on locations for
some practices. If you'd like to help bring practice to a location near you,
please get in touch!

**Communications**

Please send all questions to our new email address at {{ email() }}.
Emails to this address are seen by multiple members of the coaching staff, and
is the best way to ensure that you get an answer as quickly as possible.

Also, if you'd like to continue receiving emails and information about ARML
2025, make sure you fill out the Information Sheet to get added to this year's
email list. All further communications after this one will go to this year's
list.

Team emails will also be posted at http://sfbanorcalarml.org/, and you can go
there to see anything that you might have missed.

**T-Shirt Design Information**

In a venerable ARML tradition, we'll be designing a distinctive team t-shirt. You are invited to submit design ideas, and we will put them to a vote in early May. Here are the rules:

- T-shirt designs must be submitted by April 30th.

- All designs MUST be submitted in a vector-graphics format such as .svg or .ai. (Inkscape is free software that can create such files and is decently easy to use.)

- Designs consist of a front and a back (make a separate file for each).

- To keep printing costs low, you may use at most four colors of ink TOTAL between the front and the back: either 4 colors on one side and the other side blank, 3 colors on one side and 1 on the other, or 2 colors on each side. You are not required to use four colors; some past designs have just been simple white line art on each side.

- The design will most likely be printed on shirts of several different fabric colors. It is best if you design something that works against a variety of background colors. In our experience, white line art usually does well across a wide range of colors.

- Do not use anything offensive or anyone else's copyrighted material.

- *New for 2025*: Do not use any AI-generated designs or design elements.

Send your designs to {{ email() }} by April 30th. If you would like help with your design, send it in at least a week early, and we will do our best to help improve it.

**Action Items**

To summarize, here's what you should do right now if you're going to ARML this year:

- Sign up for ARML! Fill out the Information Sheet and pay the fee on ContestDojo by April 28th, and your spot on the team will be guaranteed.

- Tell your friends to sign up for ARML too.

- Make plans to attend practices (and ARML Local on April 27th).

- If you want to submit a t-shirt design, start working on it and submit that by April 30th.

We're looking forward to seeing you all for another fantastic year of ARML!
