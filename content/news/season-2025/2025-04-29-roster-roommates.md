Dear ARML Team,

### Roster Check

At the bottom of this email is the list of all students who are fully registered
and have a confirmed spot on our team. If you think that you're registered,
please look for your name in the list below. In case of any errors or changes,
get in touch with us as soon as possible so we can make corrections while it's
still possible to do so.

### Roommate Form

Now that our roster is pretty much set, we're giving everyone a chance to submit
roommate requests. This form is due at 11:59pm on Thursday, and we'll do our
best to accommodate requests that we receive by then. This year, the dorm rooms
are triples, and requests must be mutual - all parties need to request each
other.

[Submit your roommate preferences here.](https://forms.gle/JCXgqdhLwvioFAx38)

### Upcoming Events

We will hold one final elite team tryout online on ContestDojo on May 3. The
Bay Area teams will hold practices on May 4, 10, and 17, while Sacramento will
continue to hold weekly practices on Saturdays. The details are available at
our [practices page](/practices).

In the coming week, we will also reach out regarding transportation.  By
default, everyone's transportation will be a bus seat provided by the team. If
you're considering traveling to ARML independently with your parents, we will
have information for you soon. (In short, we will designate a drop-off time on
Friday and a pick-up time on Saturday, and ask all independent travelers to
comply with those times.)

In the coming weeks, we will also send out permission slips to parents
for electronic signatures -- watch out for instructions in future emails.

### T-Shirt Designs

As a reminder, t-shirt designs should be submitted by Wednesday, April 30.
Please see [this post](/news/season-2025/shirt-design/) for more information.  If you have
a design idea in mind, but are unable to produce a design, please send that idea
to us at {{ email() }} and we may be able to help.

### A few reminders

All team information and announcements are posted on our [homepage](/).
If you have recently joined the team, you can go there to see an archive of old
emails and announcements. 

If you have any questions, you can reach out to our coaching staff at
{{ email() }}.
