Dear ARML Team,

This email contains a lot of information about the travel logistics for our trip
to ARML in Reno on Friday and Saturday, May 30-31. Please read it carefully,
and let us know if you have any questions.

### Itinerary

Please read through the following itinerary for a detailed schedule, including
bus pickups, travel schedule, details about our time in Reno. We will send out
an updated version in a couple days with additional information, including
chaperone contact information.

Itinerary**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgCL6ZY-gL0DPXI5GkXCnleaYOG9eMIm/view?usp=sharing)

Based on the information that we have available, we have assigned students to
bus pickup locations. Please see the end of this email for an updated roster and
find your assigned pickup location. If you'd like to board the bus at a
different pickup location, please reply to this email and let us know. We will
try to accommodate such requests within the constraints of capacity limits for
our two buses.

### Alternate Transportation

A number of you have asked about traveling independently with parents to ARML. 
In order to maintain supervision during the trip, we require that any student
traveling independently to be dropped off and picked up at UNR at the
following designated times:
- Friday May 31: Drop-off between 1:30pm and 2:00pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.
- Saturday June 1: Pickup between 3:15pm and 3:30pm in the lobby of Argenta
  Hall.

If we've already recorded your intention to travel independently, your travel in
the table below should be listed as "parent". If you're assigned to the bus but
plan to travel with parents, please reply to this email and let us know, so that
we're not looking for you when loading the buses.
 
### Team and Coach Assignments

As mentioned in my previous updates, we needed to move some people around
between our regional teams in order to have teams of exactly 15 people each.
We have now done so, and everyone affected has been notified of their new team
assignments. The updated team lists are below. Students can join each team's
Discord channel by reacting in #roles (a server invite is available by clicking
on the Discord icon on the [team website](/)). 

Additionally, we will assign at least two coaches/chaperones to each team.
These coaches are the primary contacts for each team during the trip, and will
be hosting all team meetings.  Contact information for team coaches will be
listed on the next version of the itinerary.

### Student Phone Numbers

To make communication more efficient, we are collecting student cell phone
numbers for this trip. Please use the form below to report your cell phone
number. Note that this should be the number of a cell phone that you'll be
carrying with you on the trip. If you will not have a cell phone on the trip,
please indicate that on the form.

### Permission Forms

Permission forms were recently sent via SignWell to all parents using the
parent email address that was submitted in the Information Sheet last month.
Please complete the paperwork as soon as possible. No student may attend ARML
without a completed permission form. If you have not received the form, please
check your spam folder, and email me if you still can't find it.

### Optional Homework

Over the past weeks, we have uploaded three individual rounds on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/)
as optional practice material. If you'd like to partake, you may complete those
individual rounds at any time. Solutions can be found in the same
place as materials from practice:

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know!
