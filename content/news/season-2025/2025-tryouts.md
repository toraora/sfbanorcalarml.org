### Schedule

We have two online tryouts this year, both held on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/).
* April 26 (Saturday), 4pm-5pm
* May 3 (Saturday), 11am-noon

For a full tryout and practice schedule, see [Practices](/practices).

### What are tryouts for the ARML team?

While everyone who’s interested in ARML is able to participate, we will select multiple elite teams of top students who will be ranked against the top teams from other regions. To select these teams, we will hold two online evening tryout opportunities. We will additionally consider ARML Local on April 27 to be a tryout as well. While attending a tryout is not required to be selected onto an elite team, it is highly encouraged. Even if you aren’t interested in elite team selection, we still recommend attending tryouts for extra practice!

### Am I registered for the online tryouts?

If you have secured a spot on the team by registering and paying for ARML, your [ContestDojo](http://contestdojo.com/) account should have been updated to reflect membership in a team called “Registered Students”. If you see this team when you log in, that means that you’re set up correctly.

### What if I'm not planning to travel with the team this year?
### OR... What if I haven't paid for ARML yet?

If you have not paid ARML fees, you’re still welcome to participate in the tryout for extra practice. If you’d like to participate, please create a _Student_ account on [ContestDojo](http://contestdojo.com/) if you do not have one yet, and reply to this email with the email address of your [ContestDojo](http://contestdojo.com/) account. We will authorize your account to participate in the tryout as a guest student. Please note that you will need to send in your information by 15 minutes prior to the tryout start time in order to be able to start the tryout on time.

Note that if you've been given guest access to the tryouts, and you later want
to pay ARML fees and join the team on the trip, you will need to first
deactivate your guest access. You can do so by clicking the red "Unregister"
button on [ContestDojo](http://contestdojo.com/).

### What happens during a tryout?

At the tryout start time (e.g. April 26 at 4pm), we will open the tryout. Click on the button "Click here to take your tests", and you will be able to start the tryout. The tryout will consist of 10 problems in 5 pairs, 10 minute per pair. After each set, [ContestDojo](http://contestdojo.com/) will automatically advance you to the next pair, with no intervening pause. Please note that you must start the tryout within 10 minutes of the scheduled start time in order to have the full time allotted for the tryout – starting more than 10 minutes late will result in having less total time.

Please treat the tryout as you would any contest. The tryout should represent your own work, and you should not use outside resources. Do not use calculators or other computing aids during the tryout.

### Can I attend multiple tryouts?

Yes! The tryouts will have different content, and you're encouraged to come to
as many as possible. After all, this is a math team, so don't miss out on a
chance to do some fun math problems!

### What if I can't make it to a tryout?

While recommended, tryouts are not required for elite team selection. We consider a wide variety of factors in team selection, including scores from contests throughout the year. 
In particular, we understand scheduling conflicts exist, and we do not expect
every student to attend every tryout.

### What if I'm not interested in elite team placement?

We encourage everyone to participate in tryouts, regardless of interest in elite teams, since it’s good extra practice. 

### Can I review the tryout problems afterward?

After all tryouts are concluded in early May, we will link the tryout problems
and solutions on our [practice materials
document](/practices/#practice-materials-and-homework).
