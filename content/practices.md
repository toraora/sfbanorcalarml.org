### Calendar

Check out our [Season Calendar](/news/season-2025/2025-calendar/) for the full schedule.

### Info Session

We held an online info session on Wednesday, **April 16th**, at 6pm. This info session is intended for students who are new to ARML.

You can review the [recording](https://youtu.be/43vwjw4X4gk) and email us at
info@sfbanorcalarml.org if you have any questions.

### Tryouts

While everyone who's interested in ARML is able to participate, we will select multiple elite teams of top students who will be ranked against the top teams from other regions. To select these teams, we will hold two online evening tryout opportunities. We will additionally consider ARML Local on April 26/27 to be a tryout as well. While attending a tryout is not required to be selected onto an elite team, it is highly encouraged. Even if you aren't interested in elite team selection, we still recommend attending tryouts for extra practice!

### Practices

We will have three in-person practices this year, during weekends in May.

If you need to miss a practice, get that absence excused by filling out the
[Practice Absence Form](https://forms.gle/KXM5Sh6rF5qNfAxW6).

### Sacramento Area

There are also independent weekly practices for students from the Sacramento
area.
