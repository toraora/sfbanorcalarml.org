## Info Sessions, Tryouts, and Practices

### Info Sessions

We plan to hold two online info sessions during evenings in mid to late April. These info sessions will be intended for students who are new to ARML. While past team members are welcome to attend, these sessions are entirely optional.

### Tryouts

While everyone who's interested in ARML is able to participate, we plan to select multiple elite teams of top students who will be ranked against the top teams from other regions. To select these teams, we will hold two online evening tryout opportunities. We will additionally consider ARML Local on April 22/23 to be a tryout as well. While attending a tryout is not required to be selected onto an elite team, it is highly encouraged. Even if you aren't interested in elite team selection, we still recommend attending tryouts for extra practice!

### Practices

We will have three in-person practices this year, during weekends in May.

If you need to miss a practice, get that absence excused by filling out the
[Practice Absence Form](https://forms.gle/2ZYCyVhNGnKx5vY5A).

### Sacramento Area

There are also independent weekly practice for students from the Sacramento
area, both in-person at UC Davis and online for those who are unable to attend
the in-person practices. 

* Every Saturday, 6:30pm-8:30pm, online
* Every Sunday, 4pm-6:30pm at UC Davis in Mathematical Science Building (MSB) 2112.

If you're participating in ARML from the Sacramento area, contact
sacramento.math@gmail.com for more information. Sacramento area students are not
required to attend Bay Area practices and do not need to fill out Practice
Absence Forms.
